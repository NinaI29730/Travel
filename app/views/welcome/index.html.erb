<h1>Welcome to my First Ruby on Rails Site!</h1>
<p>My name is Nina Ivey Wilson. I have been a professional librarian for over 10 years. I have worked in K-12 Public School Media and Technology Centers, a Research HBCU Library, a Public Library, and a Non-Profit Organizationâ€™s Library. My interest include social justice, bridging the digital divide, data acquisition, data management, data warehousing, and knowledge discovery. With that said........</p>
<p> I have acquired the urge to build my skill set in Technology. I really like web development and software development.  So I have just complete the inital code immersion course at Tech Talent South, where I learned web development using Ruby on Rails, Bootscrap, Javascript, and MySQL. </p>
